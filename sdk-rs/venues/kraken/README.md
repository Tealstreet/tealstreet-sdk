# Kraken venue adapters

## Position liquidation prices

Futures [`open_positions`](https://docs.kraken.com/exchange/api-reference/futures-websocket/open_position)
publishes `liquidation_threshold` in the instrument's quoted price units.
Numbers and numeric strings are retained, including an explicit `0` as in
Kraken's example and the TS reference. Missing, null, empty or malformed
numeric strings are unknown; they must not default to a liquidation price of zero
or prevent the rest of the position from updating.

REST [`openpositions`](https://docs.kraken.com/api-reference/account-information/get-open-positions)
does not publish that threshold. It preserves a previously received WS value;
without one, the price is unknown. [`accounts`](https://docs.kraken.com/api-reference/account-information/get-wallets)
has different wallet shapes: `flex` / `multiCollateralMarginAccount` publishes
portfolio and margin totals, while single-collateral `fi_*` margin accounts can
include account-level `triggerEstimates.lt`. The TS reference uses accounts for
balances, not liquidation-price derivation; this adapter likewise does not
invent a per-position estimate from those totals.

Unknown prices use the packed frame's NaN representation and serialize to JSON
`null`. The SDK frame applier preserves that as `Position.liquidationPrice: null`;
finite prices and explicit zero remain numbers. Spot currently exposes wallet
balances and an empty positions table, without margin-position REST/WS mapping.

Kraken Spot treats a dispatched write's HTTP 408, 429, or 5xx response as
`Outcome::Unknown`, even when the body contains a native signature, credential,
or rate-limit error. HTTP 429 retains `ErrorKind::RateLimited` for diagnostics.
These responses cannot authorize a resend or terminal credential rejection;
uncertain placements trigger an `OpenOrders` read before another placement.

Definitive signature refusals retain the single re-sign attempt. Private reads
also retain their existing bounded signature and transport retry policies.

Futures writes likewise keep HTTP 408, 429, 5xx, and native `apiLimitExceeded`
responses unknown, including a bracket leg after an accepted entry. Their user
text says the outcome is unknown and directs the caller to Check Open Orders.
These failures never resend or place a replacement stop. Definitive refusals and
private reads retain their existing behavior.
