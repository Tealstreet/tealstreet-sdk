# Kraken venue adapters

Kraken Spot treats a dispatched write's HTTP 408, 429, or 5xx response as
`Outcome::Unknown`, even when the body contains a native signature, credential,
or rate-limit error. HTTP 429 retains `ErrorKind::RateLimited` for diagnostics.
These responses cannot authorize a resend or terminal credential rejection;
uncertain placements trigger an `OpenOrders` read before another placement.
An unknown result also refuses already-queued placements and amendments as
`Outcome::NotSent`; they were admitted before the uncertainty was known.
Queued cancellations remain available. Reconciliation never replays refused
writes: the caller checks Open Orders before explicitly retrying.

Definitive signature refusals retain the single re-sign attempt. Private reads
also retain their existing bounded signature and transport retry policies.

Futures writes likewise keep HTTP 408, 429, 5xx, and native `apiLimitExceeded`
responses unknown, including a bracket leg after an accepted entry. Their user
text says the outcome is unknown and directs the caller to Check Open Orders.
These failures never resend or place a replacement stop. Definitive refusals and
private reads retain their existing behavior.
